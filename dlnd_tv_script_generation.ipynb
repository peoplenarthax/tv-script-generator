    "So first I tried between GRU and LSTM, and both demonstrated to be fairly similar for this scenario. (Had some problems with the loss since I was inspired by our sentient analysis RNN and I used sigma in the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sequence_length I played with long ones and shorter ones, shorter ones (10 - 20) had a better convergence in the end. Probably because it is closer to the kind of output we want to generate. This last one has 8 words as closer to the average per sentence in the original data.\n",
    "For batch sizes, based on Yan LeCun, we should never use something bigger than 32 for minibatches, but then our model became very very slow, I increased the size to 128 and it seemed to be still effective. Probably in the long run 32 minibatches allow micro optimizations on this.\n",
    "For hidden and embedding I tried different coombinations based on the lectures of Udacity, embedding needs to be slightly over 200 hundred to create good relationship patterns between words. For hidden dimensions I did not have a clear output, just made it bigger than the embedding size.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the changes that helped this converge faster was to get rid of the dropout layer for the LSTM implementation, since the LSTM and GRU RNN already come with Dropout\n",
